The modular keyboard
====================

None of the keyboards I've ever used had the buttons in the right position. To
name a few issues:

- Pause and scroll lock are completely useless.

- Capslock is completely useless except if you're a keyboard and want to piss
  off your user (or if you need cruise control on the internets).

- Print, insert and menu are used so rarely some obscure key combination could
  easily replace them.

- The position of the "<>|" key on the German keyboard *sucks*.

- The absence of äöüß on US keyboards means you can't use it to write German,
  even if you like the layout otherwise (e.g. for programming).

Up to now, the best solution is getting the keyboard that sucks the least, and
then manually redefining the buttons. This takes time and system fiddling, and
the useless buttons are still laughing you in the face.

Meet my modular keyboard, named so because Lego is probably already taken. It
comes as a box of many individual keys of common sizes, and the keys can be put
together in whatever way you like on a base board. It's a keyboard where you
can decide where to put the buttons.

This idea is public because I would like you to steal it, produce it, and sell
me one.

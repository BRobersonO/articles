Companies hiring haskellers to write Haskell
============================================

This is a list of companies that were looking for Haskell developers. Only
those that made it clear that Haskell is actually used on the job, and not just
to make the ad look nice, are included.

This list should by no means be taken as a current snapshot. I add entries
as I find them, e.g. in HN "Who is hiring". Read the entries as a collection of
companies that use Haskell, with maybe a remark of in which field.
